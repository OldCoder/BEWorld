# Changes in revision 110923

# Brief summary:

# Brick Engine 5.4 or above  is  now supported  (and  required, though
# older APIs may be used for testing purposes).

# Multi-frame sprites are now supported,  both for multi-shape classes
# and for animation purposes.  In the multi-shape case,  shapes may be
# selected either by name or randomly.

# Added drop shadows,  a "God" mode power-up,  and new objects:  cars,
# dogs, pigs, and tigers. Added an animated "fire" level.  The game no
# longer needs OpenGL.  There is now a  goal: Make it to the exit. Ei-
# ther Control or Space may be used to shoot. License has  changed  to
# Creative Commons.

# More object properties are supported.  For example,  objects may now
# have random sizes that fall into a pre-defined range. Attacks by the
# player may affect them differently,  attacks by them  may affect the
# player differently, and they may make different sounds under differ-
# ent circumstances.

# Details:

# (a) Ported the program to the Brick Engine 5.4 API.

# (b) The player may now use either Left-Control or Space to shoot.

# (c) For best results, the following "cmake" rule should be used when
# Brick is built:
#
#     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RELEASE
#
# Note: This will help other Brick programs as well as BEWorld.

# (d)  A  "God mode" power-up feature is supported.  The player sprite
# used in "God mode" and  the amount of time that "God mode" lasts are
# both configurable.

# (e) Drop shadows are now  supported.  This feature may be enabled or
# disabled for objects on a per-class and/or per-world basis.

# (f) OpenGL is no longer  needed.  Non-OpenGL mode is now the default
# (though OpenGL is still supported).  However, the "cmake"  rule men-
# tioned  previously is  important.  Brick  should be built in RELEASE
# mode or BEWorld will be too slow.

# (g) Objects  may now be assigned random sizes taken from a specified
# range. The range may be set on a per-class and/or per-world basis.

# (h) Multi-frame  sprites  are  now  supported,  both for multi-shape
# classes and for animation purposes.  In the multi-shape case, shapes
# may be selected either by name or randomly.

# (i) Objects  may now make different sounds in  different circumstan-
# ces. For example, different sounds may be set for object hit by wea-
# pon and object destroyed by weapon.  The sounds  in question  may be
# set on a per-class and/or per-world basis.

# (j) Additional parameters  may now be set on a per-class and/or per-
# world basis, including:
#
# Initial health of an object
# Health effect on an  object per attack by the player
# Health effect on the player per attack by an object
# Score change if an object is destroyed by shooting
# Distance from player at which an object becomes cautious
# Whether or not an object can be attacked

# (k) Added tigers. They hide behind trees until the player happens to
# pass close by. Tigers are similar to the older enemy types but are a
# little tougher;  they can be destroyed by shooting, but more bullets
# are required.

# (l) Added dogs and pigs.  Pigs are  simply variations on cows.  Dogs
# follow the player and are friendly.  They'll fight tigers on his/her
# behalf (they're evenly matched).

# (m) Money now has different forms, is mobile, and is reluctant to be
# picked up.

# (n) The red-square enemies  are now known as  Karkinos.  They may be
# thought of as a type of crab; the crab constellation Cancer is based
# on the original Karkinos legend.

# (o) Added cars.  The player can drive a car;  while doing so, he/she
# is safe from  some attacks  but can't shoot  (attempts to shoot will
# simply beep the car's horn).

# (p) Added a global parameter  BRICKAPI that specifies the  Brick API
# to use  (5200 for  Brick 5.2, 5300 for Brick 5.3, and 5400 for Brick
# 5.4).

# For the time being, the program should run under any of the support-
# ed APIs if BRICKAPI is set correctly.  However,  there are some cav-
# eats:
#
# Older APIs  are only supported for testing  purposes.  When an older
# API is used, some features will be omitted  and others will be  only
# partly supported.
#
# If Brick 5.2 is used, a "wrap_sprite_position" patch (available sep-
# arately) must be applied  to the Brick sources and Brick must be re-
# built. The patch isn't needed for Brick 5.3 or above.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in revision 101010

# (a) Added a preliminary "help" screen;  it can be accessed using the
# "h" key.

# (b) Added the  start of a  player inventory (or backpack).  Added an
# associated "inventory" screen,  which can be accessed using  the "i"
# key.

# (c) Reorganized the information display. It has two columns now, and
# a message line has been added.

# (d) Added cows. Presently, cows are simply grazers who happen to eat
# red enemies.

# (e) Added trees. The player can hide behind trees, but only once per
# tree and shooting from there breaks cover.

# (f) Added money.  Money  simply goes  into  the  player's inventory;
# there's no way to spend it yet.

# (g) New subroutine keywords: "dmproc" and "xproc".  "dmproc" extends
# "proc" and adds some debugging features.  "xproc" extends "proc" and
# adds support for call-by-reference.

# (h) New sound effects: "moo" and "bonus"  (played  when  a health or
# financial bonus is received).

# (i) Added  support for a new  data compression format (bxdiv).  It's
# intended primarily for use with sound data.

# (j) For some  object classes  (including cows, medical kits, and red
# enemies), object are now given individual names.

# (k) Most object-related  parameters can now be set using either glo-
# bal defaults or per-world values.

# (l) The main sprite prototype setup routine (make_proto_sprite)  now
# supports up to 64 colors per sprite.

# (m) Added more documentation.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes in revision 101003

# (a) Notable user-visible items added (summary):  Multiple worlds and
# inter-world portals.  Scrolls.  Variable-size enemies. Variable-size
# random maps.  Limbo  (a world that has no map, walls,  or floor  and
# that  wraps around).  Caspak  (a world that's  simple  but not  very
# friendly).

# (b) Notable  internal features added  (summary):  "base64" decoding.
# LZ77 decompression.  Background music is now built-in.  Sprites  can
# be drawn as simple text diagrams. It's easy to add new worlds and to
# connect them in different ways. A specified number of enemies may be
# preloaded.

# (c) "base64"  decoding:  Pure-Tcl support for  "base64" decoding has
# been added. No external programs or Tcl modules are required for de-
# coding.

# (d) LZ77 decompression:  Pure-Tcl support for LZ77 decompression has
# been added. No external programs or Tcl modules are required for de-
# compression.

# The LZ77 feature  may be  used in conjunction with the "base64" fea-
# ture to load  binary data from a compressed but ASCII-encoded repre-
# sentation.

# Note: If you'd like to add  new compressed objects to this  program,
# you'll  need  to use  a  separate LZ77 compression tool named "lzbe-
# tool".  "lzbetool" is a short pure-Tcl script that should be availa-
# ble from the same place as this program.

# (e) Music: Background music is now built into the program; it's rep-
# resented as  LZ77-compressed and base64-encoded inline data.  No ex-
# ternal music file  is required.  However,  external  music files are
# still supported. For more information,  see PlayMusic and MusicFile.
# Additional minor change: The MusicVolume setting is now optional.

# (f) Sound effects: Sound effects have switched from simple "hex" en-
# coding to LZ77-compressed and base64-encoded blocks; this makes them
# significantly smaller.

# (g) Multiple worlds:  The program now  supports multiple  rooms  (or
# worlds).

# Two types of inter-world portals have been added: "forward" and "re-
# verse".  These are similar to Netscape  "down" and "up" stairs,  but
# they can be used more generally. For more information, see the docu-
# mentation section named "Inter-world portals".

# The multiple-worlds feature works  both  in  random-map  mode  (with
# RandomMapEnable set to one) and in invariant-map mode (with the par-
# ameter in question set to zero). However, in invariant-map mode, the
# coder must  pre-define an invariant map for every world that's going
# to be used.

# (h) Scrolls:  The game now  includes  scrolls.  Presently, these are
# "demo" objects that simply display random quotes (or fortunes).  The
# number of scrolls may be specified on a  per-world basis.  It may be
# set to zero, a fixed number, or a range.

# (i) Intra-world portals:  The number of  intra-world portals may now
# be set on a per-world basis.  It may be set to zero, a fixed number,
# or a range.

# (j) Enemies: Three different red-enemy sizes are now supported.  The
# size used may be set on a per-world basis. Enemies may be preloaded;
# i.e., generated as part of world creation. The  number of enemies to
# preload may be set on a per-world basis.

# (k) Info display:  The info  display  has  been  moved  to  its  own
# (transparent) layer. The code tries to keep the  info-display  layer
# on top. The width of the info display is now parameterized. The info
# display now includes the name of the current world.

# (l) Sprite definitions:  It's easy to  define  sprites  images  now;
# they're drawn as inline text.  For the time being,  all sprites have
# switched  to the  inline-text approach.  Some sprites may use  other
# approaches in the future. For more information about the new conven-
# tions, see "make_proto_sprite".

# (m) Random maps: Random maps have variable dimensions now. Addition-
# ally, some bugs in the random-map generator have been fixed.

# (n) Message screens: The arrow keys may now be used to close message
# boxes  (such  as  those  created  for  the  startup  message  and/or
# scrolls). The Escape and Q keys still work, as well.

# (o) Miscellaneous: Most of the code has been moved into subroutines.
# A fair amount of  documentation  has  been added.  Additionally, the
# program now includes "debug" code. The "debug" code is controlled by
# a new parameter named DebugLevel.

# There's now a configurable upper limit on the maximum number of bul-
# lets that can exist  simultaneously in a  given level.  The limit is
# needed because of  the  way that Limbo  works;  without a limit, the
# number of bullets might increase indefinitely.

# The B.E. text-string engine seems to limit  strings  to a few lines'
# worth of text. The program's main message-display routine (presently
# named "show_msg") has been modified  to  work around the limitation.
# The new version breaks messages up into lines and displays the lines
# separately.
